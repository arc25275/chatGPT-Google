# ChatGPT Assistant (Firefox)

> ## This extension will not work unless you generate your own key and pay on your own!

## How to use

### Get an API Key

- Log into https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and create a key

- Add a billing method in https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview
- **[Strongly reccomended!!!!]** Add a spending limit in https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits This can be something small and you will still get lots of use out of it. Current prices are about $0.002 per ~750 words (More specifically, 1000 credits, which are split up by a special algorithm used by OpenAI)
