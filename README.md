# ChatGPT Assistant (Firefox)

> ## This extension will not work unless you generate your own key and pay on your own!

> ## This extension has also not been extensively tested, so use at your own risk, though I'm not sure what problems would be able to be created. There are also some other versions of this out there but I made this for fun and practice :)

## How to use

### Get an API Key

- Log into https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and create a key

- Add a billing method in https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview
- **[Strongly reccomended!!!!]** Add a spending limit in https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits This can be something small and you will still get lots of use out of it. Current prices are about $0.002 per ~750 words (More specifically, 1000 credits, which are split up by a special algorithm used by OpenAI)
